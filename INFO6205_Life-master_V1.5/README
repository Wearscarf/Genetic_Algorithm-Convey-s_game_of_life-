* The project present the Convey's Game of life.
* The problem to solve in this project is to find the most fit individual after mutation that could be alive and grow.

* The executable java class lies in edu.neu.coe.info6205.ui.UIStart. 
  It would first initialize the User Interface panel, There are two Rule options, Rule 1 and Rule 2. Rule 1 would run the pre-selected most fit individual. Rule 2 would 
  run the entire selection process and display the most fit individual on the UI panel.
  
* When hit the "start" button, the program would using rules in individual.java class to randomly generate 
  100 grids of original pattern, which is known as genotype in Genetic Algorithm. The program would then run the Game of life on 100 genotypes for 1000 generations.
  Then mutate the result and calculate the fitness of each grid, which is also known as individual. The program would then choose the highest fitness individual
  and record it in the log4j.properties.
* The above process would repeat 10 times and record 10 most fit individual in the log4j.properties. Then the most fit individual with highest 
  fitness score would be select.
